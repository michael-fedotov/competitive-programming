# Competitive Programming Solutions

A collection of my solutions to many different programing problems. The problems come from mainly the following:

* CCC (Canadian Computing Competition)
* CCO (Candian Computing Olympiad)

# DMOJ

The majority of problems I solved on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/), an online judge and contest platform. I have opted to organize them by point value. In general (along with a competition with approximate equivalence in problem difficulty):

* 3/4 Points → Very Easy (CCC Junior)
* 5/7 Points → Easy (CCC Junior/CCC Senior)
* 10/12 Points → Normal (CCC Senior)
* 15/20 Points → Hard (CCO)
* 25/30 Points → Very Hard (IOI)
* 35+ Points → Insane (Hard IOI/ACM-ICPC Problems)

First 4 lines of comments in the solution will show: 

```
// Problem Title
// URL of problem's page
// Date of first correct submission
// Fastest running time achieved
```
